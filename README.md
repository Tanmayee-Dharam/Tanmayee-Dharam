🧠 **Analytical Thinker** – Strong grasp of **statistical modeling**, **predictive analytics**, and **ML algorithms** (Random Forest, Clustering, Time-Series).
- 💡 **Problem Solver** – Skilled at **Root Cause Analysis**, KPI development, and improving decision-making through data-backed insights.
- 🧰 **Tech Stack Pro** – Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server), Tableau, Power BI, Excel, and R.
- 🔄 **Process Improver** – Experience automating ETL processes, cleaning and aggregating datasets, and reducing manual workloads by up to 40%.
- 🌎 **Global Experience** – From working with NGOs in Texas to startups and enterprises in India, I bring a diverse and adaptable perspective.
